### **Milestone 00:**

- [Piscine Reload](https://github.com/zikocult/Cursus42/tree/main/00_piscine_reload/reload) 
	- A complete collection of exercises to remember what you have learned, a good form of training before the real "Common Core"

### **Milestone 01:**

- [LIBFT](https://github.com/zikocult/Cursus42/tree/main/01_ring/libft)
	- This is my first project as a 42-year-old student. I will need to program some functions from the standard C library, as well as other functions that will be useful throughout your course
